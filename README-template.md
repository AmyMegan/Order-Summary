## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Patiance & Thanks to the Slack Help Channel 

### What I learned

It's the first time that I've really started to code on my own without a course to do and using Flexbox. 
I learned that I'm keen to understand the html and css concepts as remembering them isn't what front-end devleopment is for me. 
I learned that, flexbox is a really smart way of being about align and sort the way you want your design to be layed out and makes any design possible. 

Below is two pieces of code that I'm proud of! 

.content {
  z-index: 6;
  background-color: white;
  height: 690px;
  width: 450px;
  text-align: center;
  border-radius: 15px 15px 15px 15px;
  border-bottom-style: solid 	#FFFFFF;
  border-top-style: solid 	#FFFFFF;
  border-left-style: solid 	#FFFFFF;
  border-right-style: solid 	#FFFFFF;
}

.container {
  z-index: 7;
 background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
 display: flex;
 flex-direction: column;
 align-content: center;
 flex-wrap: wrap;
 padding: 100px;
 min-height: 100vh;
 background: top/100% 50% no-repeat
      url("https://i.postimg.cc/Wp8FmR33/imageonline-co-whitebackgroundremoved-2.png"),
    #e0e8ff;
}

### Continued development

In my next project I will use CSS Flexbox. More than ever all websites have flexable designs to them.
I'm excited to see how my next project will turn out!? How will my processes change and how I overcome problems I face.
